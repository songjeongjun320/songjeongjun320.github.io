## About me

Hello! 😊 I'm **(Jun) JeongJun Song**, a passionate **Computer Science** student at **Arizona State University**, with a projected graduation in **December 2025**. I am currently working as a **FURI Researcher** at ASU, where I focus on leveraging **AI** and **Machine Learning** technologies. Previously, I interned at **NGL Transportation**, where I applied AI models to enhance operational efficiency. My journey is driven by a love for solving real-world problems and creating impactful solutions that enhance lives. 🌍

Currently, I'm working on several exciting projects, including developing a **Yard Management System (YMS)** with **Professor Ryan Meuth**, using **machine learning object detection** to address logistical challenges. I'm also collaborating with **Professor Hitendra Chaturvedi** on a **Business Contract Analyzer** that detects toxic clauses to provide better contract recommendations for users. 📄✨

In addition, I developed apps like **MindVillage**, which support individuals dealing with depression and mental health issues. Through tools like **LLMs** and projects such as "_Why don't you be more nice(r)_", I am striving to foster an ethical and moral internet environment. 🧠💚

I’m inspired by companies like **Lamborghini** 🚗, which started as a tractor company, **Samsung** 🛒, originally a grocery store, and **Steve Jobs** 🍏, who began Apple in garage. **Tesla** ⚡, once near bankruptcy, is now expanding humanity’s reach into space. 🚀 These stories inspire me to aim high, and while my journey may seem modest now, my ultimate goal is to achieve something meaningful that can inspire others in the future. 🌟

Thank you for visiting my website. While I may seem inexperienced now, I’m committed to learning and growing continuously. I hope to be a source of inspiration for others in the next 10 or 20 years. 🌱
