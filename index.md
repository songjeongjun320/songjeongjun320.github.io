## About me

Hello, I'm **JeongJun Song**, a passionate **Computer Science** student at Arizona State University, with a projected graduation in **December 2025**. My journey in technology is driven by a love for solving real-world problems using machine learning and OCR technologies. Over the past two years, I've gained hands-on experience in full-stack development and object-oriented programming.

Currently, I'm leading the Vision AI Insights Project as a **_FURI Research Aide_** at Arizona State University [Fulton Engineering School](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/furi/). In this role, I've conducted in-depth analyses of advanced machine learning models like **YOLOv10** and implemented cost-effective OCR solutions integrating **PyTesseract** and **AWS Textract**. My work has significantly improved real-time performance and resource utilization.

Previously, I interned at [NGL Transportation INC](https://ngltrans.com/), where I enhanced image detection accuracy and reduced processing time through AI model development and efficient workflows. I also streamlined data integration processes and managed substantial daily data transactions on **AWS**.

In addition to my technical skills, I have experience automating data crawling tasks and converting applications into executable programs, which has greatly increased operational efficiency.

Beyond academics and professional work, I served in the [Hanbit Unit](https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200512000971) of the United Nations in South Sudan, where I was responsible for transporting personnel and providing interpretation services. This experience honed my leadership and teamwork skills in high-pressure environments.

I look forward to leveraging my expertise in **Machine Learning**, **OCR**, and **Full-Stack** development to contribute to innovative projects and continue my growth in the tech industry. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or explore my work on GitHub.
