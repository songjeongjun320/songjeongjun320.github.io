### 🌟 **Final Remarks** 🌟

At this year's Hacks for Humanity, our team worked together to merge ideas from both developers and non-developers, creating **MindVillage**, a platform focused on addressing mental health. Although we didn't win an award, the experience of collaborating with diverse perspectives was incredibly valuable.

One moment that left a lasting impression was a judge's personal story. They shared how, during college, their fear of public speaking led them to drop out of their major, yet they now confidently speak in front of others. The key message: **Don’t let fear hold you back—what frightens you today may not tomorrow.**

We hope **MindVillage** inspires others to engage with mental health support in meaningful ways. Let's build a better digital space for everyone.

**Thank you**
