  - Chose front-end language
  - Redesigned main page function
- **Next Steps:**
  - Minimize sent picture amount to 3-5
  - Continue labeling using "superannotate"
  - Set up AWS account

#### Week 9

- **Updates:**
  - YOLO now stops processing after detecting 3 valuable pictures
  - Revised main page to show line by line
  - Decided to use HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- **Next Steps:**
  - Revise for clearer pictures and trim logic

  - Develop frontend "main_detail" page

#### Week 10

- **Updates:**
  - Revised YOLO logic to detect all pictures and select the best quality ones
  - Decided to send images to Textract first, then to AWS S3 bucket if successful
  - Developed container detail page functionality in frontend
- **Next Steps:**
  - Continue labeling using "superannotate" (3000 pictures per member)
  - Revise backend logic to send image with maximum clarity
  - Develop login page
  - Set up SQL integration for main page

#### Week 11

- **Updates:**
  - Connected to Textract and extracted container number results
  - Set up Login Page with sign-up and sign-in features
- **Next Steps:**
  - Strengthen the Login Page with duplication account error handling and reset password feature
  - Debug DB connection error and encrypt DB access key
  - Create a JSON file with date, time, and container number information from Textract results

#### Week 12

- **Updates:**
  - Refined the string data from Textract and contracted the container number and size
  - Strengthened the Login Page by adding Sign-up and Reset password features
- **Next Steps:**
  - Set up the database with PostgreSQL
  - Continue refining data from Textract and revising it to contract the container number and size

#### Week 13

- **Updates:**
  - Changed logic from using Laplacian for image clarity to using YOLOâ€™s confidence as an accuracy indicator
  - Continued strengthening the Login Page with Sign-up and Reset password features
- **Next Steps:**
  - Set up Node.js and Supabase for the backend
  - Establish API communication between frontend and backend

---

**Current Work:**
Developing a real-time business web page for end users using Supabase, PostgreSQL, and Next.js.
