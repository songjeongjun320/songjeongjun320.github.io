# Gateway OCR Project

## Overview

The Gateway OCR project is designed to automate the detection and extraction of container numbers from CCTV footage using advanced machine learning and OCR technologies. This project enhances the efficiency of container management by ensuring accurate and timely data capture, facilitating seamless integration with Yard Management Systems (YMS).

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to improve the accuracy and scalability of container number detection and extraction processes. By leveraging machine learning models and optimizing the OCR pipeline, the project aims to minimize missing transactions and provide sustainable, readable, and documented code.

### Project Repository

[OCR_CNTR_Number GitHub Repository](https://github.com/songjeongjun320/OCR_CNTR_Number)

## Workflow

### CCTV System (Synology)

- A motion detection system captures images when movement is detected.
- Images are sent to a file server via FTP and stored as “Sample_File”.

### Container Number Region Detection (YOLOv5)

- YOLOv5 is used to detect the region containing the container number in the images or video files.

### Container Number Detection (NGL_OCR Engine)

- The NGL_OCR engine processes images to detect and extract container numbers, making use of Tesseract OCR for text recognition.

### Upload to YMS

- Extracted data, including date, time, and container number, is uploaded to the Yard Management System.
