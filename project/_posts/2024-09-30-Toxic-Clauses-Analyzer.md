💡 **Business Contract Analyzer** is a powerful tool designed to analyze business contracts for individuals and companies alike. Through this platform, users can identify vulnerabilities in their contracts, discover potential toxic clauses, and understand how these clauses might lead to financial losses. Our research-driven model provides insights in an easily digestible format, empowering users to make informed decisions. The goal of our platform is to analyze contract weaknesses more efficiently and quickly, offering alternatives without incurring costly lawyer fees, whether for personal use or business purposes. 🌱 **Transform your contract analysis experience!**
