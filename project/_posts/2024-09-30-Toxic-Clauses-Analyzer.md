## Project Overview

💡 **Business Contract Analyzer** is a powerful tool designed to analyze business contracts for individuals and companies alike. Through this platform, users can identify vulnerabilities in their contracts, discover potential toxic clauses, and understand how these clauses might lead to financial losses. Our research-driven model provides insights in an easily digestible format, empowering users to make informed decisions. The goal of our platform is to analyze contract weaknesses more efficiently and quickly, offering alternatives without incurring costly lawyer fees, whether for personal use or business purposes. 🌱 **Transform your contract analysis experience!**

## Features ✨

- **Page Splitting**: Users can upload a PDF file and automatically split it into separate pages.
- **Text Extraction**: The tool extracts text from each PDF page, saving it as a clean text file.
- **Organized Output**: Splitted PDFs and extracted text files are saved in clearly defined directories for easy access through the model.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Python (PyPDF2 and pdfminer libraries)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Environment**: Node.js for server-side logic

### 🌟 **Final Remarks** 🌟

At this year's Hacks for Humanity, our team worked together to merge ideas from both developers and non-developers, creating **Business Contract Analyzer**, a platform focused on addressing contract vulnerabilities. Although we didn't win an award, the experience of collaborating with diverse perspectives was incredibly valuable.

We hope **Business Contract Analyzer** inspires others to engage with contract analysis in meaningful ways. Let's build a better digital space for everyone.

**Thank you**
