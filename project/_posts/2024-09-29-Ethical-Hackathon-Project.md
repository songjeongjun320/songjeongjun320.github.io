## Project Overview

💡 **"Why don't you be more nicer?"** This is our project. Many people hide behind the screen of a monitor, causing harm and inflicting pain on others in everyday life. We aim to overcome this issue. Our project is not about stopping those who leave hurtful comments. Instead, it focuses on giving them a chance to think again. It’s not about preventing them from trying to hurt others, but rather providing an opportunity for reflection. 🌱 **One sentence from someone can impact another person.** We strive for a better internet networking culture—ethically. Now. _"Why don't you be more nicer?"_

### 🌟 **Final Remarks** 🌟

Once again, we witness too many people hiding behind the internet to harm others. **Countless individuals fall into despair, and tragically, some even lose their lives.** Isn't it ironic? That mere words can cost a precious life?
We aim to build a more ethical internet culture and hope that our project contributes to this mission.

**Thank you**
